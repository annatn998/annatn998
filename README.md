### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

# About Me 

My name is Anna! ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as a Data Scientist in London! I specialize in development of machine learning algorithms using Python and have a **MSc in Data Science** from **Birkbeck University**  While working I've gained experience with NLP for Sentiment Analysis and Graph Building & Graph Neural Networks. But I'm super keen on learning more about computer vision and reinforcement learning! In the past year, I've also taken up Django and video game development on the side (hoping to someday make my own video game and then train an RL agent to learn how to play it!). 


# Recent Projects 
- I've recently been volunteering my time as back-end developer to a non-for-profit which I helped to get up and running during hack-a-thon
